  ============= HELP ======================
  1. See sample file termbase.c  It helps you to get started.

  2. termbase.c assumes only one directory: ./ for commands
     In your working directory (where you compile-run termbase.c), enter

  ln -s /bin/ls  myls
  ln -s /bin/cat mycat

  so that your CWD has myls and mycat

  When run termbase.c, enter commands   myls  OR  mycat filename
  
  3. Modify termbase.c to meet requirements of the assignment
